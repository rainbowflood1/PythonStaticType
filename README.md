# _Make Python partially statically typed!_
## Here's how to get started!

- First, here's all of the types:
1. So there's `int`, `char`, `list`, `float`, `complex` and `bool`.
- Second, I will show you how to increment and decrement variables:
1.  there's `++` and `--` it's the same as `+= 1` and `-= 1`.
- Thired, there is `NULL` it is the same as `None` and it's optional.
- Fifth, `True` and `False` is not case-sensitive, but it is optional.

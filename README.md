# Make Python partially statically typed!
## Here's how to get started!

- First, here's all of the types:
  1. So there's `int`, `char`, `list`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`, and `dict`.
  2. If you want to make a variable with those types then insert into your Python source file:
  ```cpp
  int var = 1
  // You can replace "int" with any type listed and the variable has to match that type.
  ```
- Second, I will show you how to increment and decrement variables:
  1.  There's `++` and `--` it's the same as `+= 1` and `-= 1`.
- Thired, there's `NULL` it is the same as `None` and it's optional.
- Forth, there's `::` instead of `.`.
- Fifth, 
- The syntax is related to **C++**.
